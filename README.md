# 50 Projects in 50 days - HTML/CSS and JavaScript

### This Repository will "mostly "duplicate (but was not cloned from) Brad Traversy's 50 Projects in 50 days - a Udemy Course.

If you need to practice writing code in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript but can't think of anything to do, this course is a great choice.

You won't build anything groundbreaking or very useful, but it can be fun and it will sharpen your skills.

I've been spoiled by WordPress for quite some time and I feel the need to brush up on things I may have known but have since forgotten due to lack of using it. The idea here is to just get some practice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as learn more about Git and Github.

I'm doing the projects, but I didn't want to just clone his repo because, even though I've used github before, I'm not really great at it yet. I wanted to be in control of my own repository to test out things like branching & pull requests and such.

I've been dealing with HTML, CSS, and Javascript forever. Well, since they were each created as I have been designing webpages/sites since 1995 and I was on the internet (USENET) though dial-up BBS even earlier than that. (My first modem was 300baud) So, "I was geeky when geeky wasn't cool".

I actually run a digital agency called [Hassebrock, Inc.](https://hassebrock-inc.com) in Pensacola, FL where I design and host websites. If you need a website to build your brand or just need a clean modern look for your existing site, then you should get in touch with me.

Thank you, Brad, not just for this but also for the many other bits of code you've taught me or helped me to remember. Your Udemy classes are excellent, and I enjoy watching your videos on YouTube. Whenever you put out new work, I always look forward to checking it out.

Also, I want to mention Florin Pop. From what I understand, he is the one who built the projects in this course. So, thank you for making it possible for Brad to bring us these great projects.
